# HIPY - Haskell Interpreter for Python

HIPY is a Python interpreter written in Haskell. It aims to provide a lightweight and functional approach to executing Python code, leveraging Haskell's strong type system and purity to ensure correctness and maintainability.

## Features

Planned features:

- âœ… Parsing of Python source code
- âœ… Evaluation of Python expressions and statements
- âœ… Support for basic Python data types (integers, strings, booleans etc.)
- âœ… Support for complex Python data types (lists, dictionaries etc.)
- âœ… Control flow structures (if/else, while, loops)
- ðŸš§ (WIP) Complex control flow (match, case)
- ðŸš§ (WIP) Error handling (try/catch/finally, throw, assert etc.)
- âœ… Function definitions and calls
- ðŸš§ (WIP) Global and local variables
- ðŸš§ (WIP) Python standard library

Not planning to implement:

- Object Oriented Programming (class, this, etc.)
- Concurrency (async, await etc.)

## Installation

To build HIPY, you will need:

- GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) >= 9.0.0  
- Cabal for dependency management  


### Using cabal

```sh
git clone https://github.com/coloursplash/hipy.git
cd hipy
cabal build
cabal run . -- example.py
```

## Usage
HIPY runs Python scripts passed as command-line arguments:

```sh
hipy script.py
```

### Example
Create a Python script:

```python
# script.py
x = 10
y = 20
print(x + y)  # Output: 30
```

Run it with:

```python
hipy script.py
```
